# PythonHopfield

I use Hopfield network as example of associative memory. In programs have been implemented two methods of calculating weights for patterns. These were Hebb's methods and pseudo-inversion.

The network was checked for one modified pattern from each set. Patterns for 4x4 and 6x6 are generated letters and numbers. The code has been checked for a test image generated by changing one of the patterns
